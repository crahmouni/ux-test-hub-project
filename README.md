# UX Test Hub
UX Test Hub is a comprehensive platform that facilitates usability testing and the validation of digital prototypes in a collaborative and iterative way. Designed for design and development teams, the tool allows you to upload interactive prototypes and receive direct feedback from end users through comments, annotations, and interaction metrics analysis.

On the backend, built with Node.js and Express, it handles key aspects such as authentication, data storage, and database connectivity. This ensures that test information is collected securely and in an organized manner, providing valuable insights into the user experience.

The frontend, developed with React and bundled using Vite, offers an intuitive and agile interface that makes navigation easy for both system administrators and users participating in the tests. The user experience is enhanced by a clear presentation of statistics and results, enabling the quick identification of areas for design improvement.

In summary, UX Test Hub speeds up the digital product validation process by bringing together designers, developers, and testers on a single platform. Its modular and scalable architecture makes it an adaptable solution for projects of any size, helping to turn feedback into concrete actions to improve product quality and usability.
